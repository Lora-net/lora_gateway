LoRa Gateway project
=====================

1. Core library: libloragw
---------------------------

This directory contains the sources of the library to build a gateway based on 
a Semtech LoRa multi-channel RF receiver (a.k.a. concentrator).
Once compiled all the code is contained in the libloragw.a file that will be 
statically linked (ie. integrated in the final executable).

The library also comes with a bunch of basic tests programs that are used to 
test the different sub-modules of the library.

2. Helper programs
-------------------

Those programs are included in the project to provide examples on how to use 
the HAL library, and to help the system builder test different parts of it.

### 2.1. util_pkt_logger ###

This software is used to set up a LoRa concentrator using a JSON configuration
file and then record all the packets received in a log file, indefinitely, until
the user stops the application.

### 2.2. util_spi_stress ###

This software is used to check the reliability of the link between the host
platform (on which the program is run) and the LoRa concentrator register file
that is the interface through which all interaction with the LoRa concentrator
happens.

### 2.3. util_tx_test ###

This software is used to send test packets with a LoRa concentrator. The packets
contain little information, on no protocol (ie. MAC address) information but
can be used to assess the functionality of a gateway downlink using other
gateways as receivers.

### 2.4. util_tx_continuous ###

This software is used to set LoRa concentrator in Tx continuous mode,
for spectral measurement.

### 2.5. util_spectral_scan ###

This software is used to scan the spectral band in background, where the LoRa
gateway operates.

### 2.6. util_lbt_test ###

This software is used to test "Listen-Before-Talk" channels timestamps.

3. Helper scripts
-----------------

### 3.1. reset_lgw.sh

This script must be launched on IoT Start Kit platform to reset concentrator
chip through GPIO, before starting any application using the concentrator.

4. Changelog
-------------

### v4.0.1 ###

* HAL: SX1301AP2: Only FPGA v27 is supported, removed (v18,v19) from the list
        of supported FPGA images.

WARNING: If you are using a Semtech SX1301AP2 ref design (GW1.5), the FPGA must
be reprogrammed with one of the images provided with this release (fpga/ dir).

### v4.0.0 ###

* HAL: Added "Listen-Before-Talk" support for Semtech SX1301AP2 Ref Design.
       A description of the feature implementation can be found in
       libloragw/readme.md.
* HAL: Updated FSK RSSI calculation for better linearization
* util_lbt_test: New utility provided for basic "Listen-Before-Talk" testing.
* util_tx_test: Extended to configure and test "LBT" through the HAL.
* Added a reset_lgw.sh script to be used with IoT Starter Kit (v1.0) to reset
the concentrator through the HOST GPIO pin.

### v3.2.1 ###

* HAL: Fixed downlink support for SX1301AP2 reference design: soft reset of the
FPGA was missing for proper IQ inversion configuration.
* HAL: Added support for several versions of FPGA (currently v18 and v19)
* HAL: Reduced radio TX PLL bandwidth to reduce the noise level.
* util_tx_test: Added FSK support and added minimal TX gain LUT.
* util_spectral_scan: Removed FPGA soft reset, now done by the HAL.
* util_tx_continous: reworked to use HAL functions instead of 'manual' config,
and use same SX1301 calibration firmware as the HAL.
* Updated all makefiles to handle the creation of obj directory when necessary.
* Change cs_change usage policy in SPI module to let the driver handle the chip
select.

### v3.2.0 ###

* Added support for SX1301AP2 reference design (with FPGA and additional
SX127x). When a FPGA is detected at startup, the HAL automatically adapts SPI
communication requests (using SPI header or not).
* Added util_spectral_scan diagnostic tool to scan the spectral band in
background, where the LoRa gateway operates. (can only be used with SX1301AP2
or similar design). By default it uses the same SPI device as the one used by
the HAL, but it can be changed depending on the hardware architecture on which
it is used by updating the SPI_DEV_PATH constant defined in file
util_spectral_scan/src/loragw_fpga_spi.c.
Note: when using same SPI device from 2 applications, we rely on the host SPI
driver and OS to properly handle concurrent SPI requests. It has been tested on
Raspberry Pi / Raspbian with spi_bcm2708 driver.* Removed SPI FTDI support due
to lack of performances to properly handle heavy packet traffic. Only native
SPI usage is recommended.
* HAL: added a check that SX1301 firmwares have been properly loaded at startup.

### v3.1.0 ###

* Removed GPIO module from HAL, that was specific to IoT Starter Kit platform.
GPIO configuration will be done from application script instead.
* Removed CFG_BRD configuration from library.cfg, not needed anymore

### v3.0.2 ###

* Bugfix: Fixed frequency calculation on uplinks: lgw_receive() function was
using a variable to calculate the frequency before it was initialized with
correct value. 
* Bugfix: util_pkt_logger crashed when no gateway_ID is not defined in
global_conf.json

### v3.0.1 ###

* Bufgix: Fixed util_tx_continuous compilation issue, by adding empty obj
directory
* Bugfix: Fixed HAL compilation issue for CFG_SPI=ftdi, removed dependency on
loragw_gpio in this case

### v3.0.0 ###

* Added new HAL function lgw_board_setconf() to configure board/concentrator
specific parameters: network type (LoRa public or private), concentrator clock
source. Note: those parameters are not any more set from the library.cfg file
configuration (CFG_NET, CFG_BRD),
and should be passed at initialization by the application.
* Added new HAL function lgw_txgain_setconf() to configure concentrator TX gain
table. It can now be dynamically set by the application at initialization time.
* Changed HAL function lgw_rxrf_setconf(), it will now also configure the radio
type (CFG_RADIO has been removed from library.cfg), the RSSI offset to be used
for this radio and if TX is enabled or not on this radio.
* Added support of IoT Starter Kit platform, which is now the default board.
* Added util_tx_continuous utility for gateway TX power calibration and
spectral emission measurements/qualification.
* Removed CFG_BAND configuration from library.cfg. Band configuration is done
by application and passed dynamically at initialization time.
* Updated makefiles to allow cross compilation from environment variable (ARCH,
CROSS_COMPILE).

** WARNING: **
** Known issue: a problem with carrier leakage calibration has been seen on
433MHz boards. **

### v2.0.0 ###

* Added support for Kerlink 868 27dBm gateway
* Updated global_conf.eu868.json (in packet logger) to new LoRaWAN frequency
plan
* Added version numbers to AGC, arbiter and calibration firmware (those
versions are checked at startup)
* Added test_loragw_cal to test radio calibrations
* Fixed minor bug in error coverage in register read/write functions

/!\ warning: Kerlink 868 27dBm gateway includes a FPGA that MUST be programmed
before running any application

### v1.7.0 ###

* Added TX 'start delay' compensation for timestamp mode (fix time window
alignment issue at low SF and/or high BW)
* Added adaptive narrowband/wideband TX filtering for LoRa

* Added notes for TX 'start delay' in immediate and triggered mode

/!\ warning: due to start delay compensation being implemented, TX that were 
previously 1.5ms late will be sent on time. At low datarate, this is not an 
issue. At high LoRa data rate (and FSK) you might have to adjust your timing.

### v1.6.0 ###

### v1.2.1 ###

* Fixed 'floating point exception' crash when concentrator returned a packet
with SF=0 (CRC error on LoRa header).
* Fixed buggy timezone handling.

### v1.2.0 ###

* Added feature: new GPS module in the library for synchronization.
* Removed feature: no more missed deadline detection in TX because of
incompatibility with GPS.
* Added documentation for GPS and legal notice.
